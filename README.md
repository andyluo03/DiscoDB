# DiscoDB

Have you ever had so much JSON lying around you didn't know what to do with it? With the ridiculous prices companies such as MongoDB charge, I don't blame you. Fortunately, we made DiscoDB, a NoSQL document database that uses a novel method to promise UNLIMITED storage at ZERO cost -- that's right, *unlimited* -- all for free!
